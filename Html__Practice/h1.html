    <h1>Static vs Dynamic Loading</h1>
The choice between Static or Dynamic Loading is to be made at the time of computer program
being developed. If you have to load your program statically, then at the time of compilation,
the complete programs will be compiled and linked without leaving any external program or
module dependency. The linker combines the object program with other necessary object
modules into an absolute program, which also includes logical addresses.
If you are writing a Dynamically loaded program, then your compiler will compile the
program and for all the modules which you want to include dynamically, only references will
be provided and rest of the work will be done at the time of execution.
At the time of loading, with static loading, the absolute program (and data) is loaded into
memory in order for execution to start.
If you are using dynamic loading, dynamic routines of the library are stored on a disk in
relocatable form and are loaded into memory only when they are needed by the program.
Static vs Dynamic Linking
As explained above, when static linking is used, the linker combines all other modules needed
by a program into a single executable program to avoid any runtime dependency.
When dynamic linking is used, it is not required to link the actual module or library with the
program, rather a reference to the dynamic module is provided at the time of compilation and
linking. Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) in Windows and Shared Objects in Unix are good
examples of dynamic libraries.
Swapping
Swapping is a mechanism in which a process can be swapped temporarily out of main memory
(or move) to secondary storage (disk) and make that memory available to other processes. At
some later time, the system swaps back the process from the secondary storage to main
memory.
Though performance is usually affected by swapping process but it helps in running multiple
and big processes in parallel and that's the reason Swapping is also known as a technique
